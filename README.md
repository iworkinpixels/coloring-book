Coloring Book

This is the webpage developed in conjunction with the Koloric Konfabulator, which was  our entry to the qualifier for the 2013 Red Bull Creation contest... it takes serial data (gathered via the Seriality plugin) and uses it to use masking in ImageMagick to create a colored version of a selected page from E is for Electronics.
